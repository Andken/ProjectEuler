-- Prob 47
-- The first two consecutive numbers to have two distinct prime factors are:
-- 
-- 14 = 2  7
-- 15 = 3  5
-- 
-- The first three consecutive numbers to have three distinct prime factors are:
-- 
-- 644 = 2Â²  7  23
-- 645 = 3  5  43
-- 646 = 2  17  19.
-- 
-- Find the first four consecutive integers to have four distinct primes factors. What is the first of these numbers?
